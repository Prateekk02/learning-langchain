The Zento X5 offers excellent value for its price, with a sleek design and vibrant display.
Its battery life easily lasts a full day even with heavy usage.
The camera quality is decent in good lighting but struggles a bit in low light.
Performance is smooth for everyday tasks, though not ideal for high-end gaming.
Overall, a solid choice for budget-conscious users.
