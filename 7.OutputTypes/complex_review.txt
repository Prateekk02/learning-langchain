The display is gorgeous, but the fingerprint sensor is a bit inconsistent. I wish the software experience felt more polished. Still, it's a solid device for most users.

I recently switched to the OnePlus 12 Pro, and I must say, the display is absolutely breathtaking! The AMOLED screen with 120Hz refresh rate makes every interaction smooth and immersive. Whether I’m watching videos, scrolling social media, or gaming, the visuals are stunning. Battery life is impressive too—easily lasts through the day even with heavy usage, and the 80W fast charging is a game-changer.

The in-display fingerprint scanner, however, can be hit-or-miss. Sometimes it works instantly, and other times I have to press it multiple times. The OxygenOS skin has improved, but it still lacks some of the polish and fluidity you’d expect at this price point.

The phone is sleek and lightweight, making it comfortable to hold for long durations. The camera system is solid, especially the main sensor which captures vibrant, detailed shots. Low-light photography is decent, but not the best in class.

Pros:
Gorgeous AMOLED display with 120Hz refresh rate
Excellent battery life with super-fast charging
Powerful performance with Snapdragon 8 Gen 3
Premium build quality and sleek design

Cons:
Fingerprint sensor is inconsistent
OxygenOS still feels slightly undercooked
Low-light camera performance could be better
